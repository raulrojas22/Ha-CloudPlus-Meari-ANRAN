## Transport

- Official apps subscribe to Meari IoT events through **MQTT over TLS**
  using the host/port and `mqttSignature` returned by the platform config
  API.
- MQTT parameters as used by the apps and this integration:
  - **Client id** = numeric user id
  - **Username** = platform access id
  - **Password** = `mqttSignature`
  - **Clean session** = `true`
  - **Keepalive** = `300`
- The app keeps **one Meari MQTT session per account** and dispatches events
  to cameras internally. Multiple MQTT sessions with the same user-id /
  client-id can make the broker disconnect older sessions — this is the
  single most common cause of "no motion events in HA": another live login
  (phone, second HA instance, etc.) is bumping us off.
- **The broker pins the MQTT client-id to the numeric user-id.** Connecting
  with any other client-id is rejected with CONNACK *Not authorized* (verified
  against the live EU broker). So we cannot side-step the collision by picking
  a unique client-id — HA and the phone app *must* both connect as the
  user-id and therefore evict each other. There is no MQTT-layer fix; the
  remedies are a dedicated HA account (so nothing competes) **and** the
  polling fallback below (which works regardless of who owns the live socket).
- The setup docs recommend a dedicated secondary account for HA for exactly
  this reason.

## Topics

- Default motion topic:
  ```
  $bsssvr/iot/{userId}/{userId}/event/update/accepted
  ```
- When the account has a multi-login client id, the app subscribes to:
  ```
  $bsssvr/iot/{clientId}/{userId}/event/update/accepted
  ```
  instead. The integration mirrors that behaviour when it detects a
  multi-login client id in the platform config.

## Payload shapes

Event payloads are **not stable** — different cameras / firmwares wrap them
differently. The parser must accept any of:

- top-level fields directly on the message
- a `params` object
- a `data` object
- a `result` object
- an `items` array

Alarm-type fields the parser looks for, in order:

- `eventType`
- `alarmType`
- `imageAlertType`
- `alertType`
- `evt`

See [`const.py`](../custom_components/cloudplus/const.py) `ALARM_TYPE_NAMES`
and `MOTION_ALARM_TYPES` for the active mapping. The motion binary sensor
fires for any alarm in `MOTION_ALARM_TYPES = {1, 2, 11, 20}` (PIR, Motion,
Human body, Person). Other alarm types (Visitor, Noise, Package, etc.) are
classified by `motion_event.py` but currently routed only to logs / future
event sensors.

At `DEBUG` level the listener logs the full raw event under the grep-target
`MQTT motion raw event:` (truncated to 2000 chars). Use it to see which
fields a given camera firmware sends — in particular whether the event
carries an image/clip URL, which would be the only way to get a snapshot of
the exact motion moment rather than a frame fetched after the camera wakes.

## Binary sensor semantics

The motion binary sensor is a **pulse**, not a latch. It turns on for any
alarm in `MOTION_ALARM_TYPES` and clears `MOTION_HOLD_S` (20 s) after the last
event, while the camera itself stays awake for `CONF_MOTION_TIMEOUT`
(default 120 s). Keeping the two independent matters: if the sensor stayed on
for the whole awake window, a second motion inside that window would produce no
state change and automations keyed on `to: "on"` would only ever fire once.

## Fallback: cloud event polling

Because the MQTT session is regularly evicted whenever the account is also
logged in on a phone (see Transport — the broker forces client-id == user-id),
polling is **not just a catch-up source, it is the path that actually works**
for most users. The MQTT push stays as the low-latency bonus when nothing
competes (e.g. a dedicated HA account).

The poller mirrors the official app's Messages tab and reads the real
per-device **event log**, once per registered camera:

```
GET /v3/app/event/list   { deviceID, day=YYYYMMDD, direction=1, index=0 }
→ { "alertMsg": [ { "msgID", "eventType", "eventTime", "deviceID", … }, … ] }
```

The per-device log remains primary over the older `/v3/app/event/new/get` summary for three
reasons, all of which broke motion for real users:

- **Read-state independent.** `event/new/get` returns an `evt` *has-unread
  flag* (not the alarm type) plus `imageAlertType`. Once the phone app reads
  the notification, `evt` flips to `"0"` and our parser — which keys on `evt`
  first — classified it as a non-motion event, so the sensor never fired.
  `event/list` always returns the full day's events regardless of read-state.
- **Correct alarm type.** `event/list` entries carry the actual `eventType`
  (e.g. `2` = Motion), so `parse_motion_event` classifies them correctly
  without relying on the ambiguous `evt` flag.
- **Stable de-dup.** Each entry has a unique `msgID`; we remember
  `(deviceID, msgID)` so the same event is never re-fired. The seed pass at
  startup records existing ids without dispatching; the set is cleared on day
  rollover and capped to stay bounded.

The poller also calls:

```
GET /v3/app/event/new/get { listAllDevice=1 } → { "result": { "device": [ { "evt", "imageAlertType", "devLocalTime", "deviceID", … }, … ] } }
```

Those summary rows are a secondary source only. They are de-duplicated by the
reported device and local event time (or a stable raw-row fallback), seeded on
startup without dispatching, and parsed with `imageAlertType` so `evt` still
behaves as a read/unread flag rather than the alarm type.

`MotionEventListener` polls every `ALARM_POLL_INTERVAL` (15 s), so worst-case
motion latency without MQTT is ~15 s.

All cloud requests have finite connect/read timeouts. If both event-log
sources fail, the account-scoped listener performs a fresh platform login,
updates the MQTT credentials used for later reconnects, and resumes polling.
This prevents an expired token or a wedged HTTPS connection from leaving
motion delivery permanently stopped until Home Assistant restarts.

Re-authentication is **cooldown-limited** (`REAUTH_COOLDOWN_S`, 5 min): a
shared account that keeps failing would otherwise re-login on every failed
cycle, and that login churn is itself a suspected trigger of the cloud-side
`1023` throttle. Polling cadence is unchanged (`ALARM_POLL_INTERVAL` on
success, `ALARM_POLL_ERROR_INTERVAL` on failure), so worst-case latency is the
same as before. The API client additionally retries a `1023` response in place
(up to `TRANSIENT_RETRIES`, re-signing each attempt) before a request is
treated as failed — see [protocol.md](protocol.md).

## Practical guidance

- If MQTT connect logs `Bad user name or password`, low-latency MQTT push is
  unavailable for that session but cloud polling remains active.
- If MQTT events stop after running for a long time, check that no other
  client is logging in with the same account. The broker silently drops the
  older session.
- If you intentionally share an account between phone and HA, the
  event-log poll will still surface every event within ~15 s, but the live
  MQTT push will keep flapping. **Use a dedicated HA account** if you want the
  sub-second MQTT push as well.
- Alarm types observed in the wild but not currently in `MOTION_ALARM_TYPES`
  are intentionally non-motion (e.g. `21 SD card removed`, `10 Tamper`).
  Adding them to motion would create false positives.
